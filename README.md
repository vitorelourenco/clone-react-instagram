Something went wrong with the untracked files in the other repo so this is a fresh repo with everything working. If you would like to check out the older commits, you can find them at https://github.com/vitorelourenco/deprecated-react-instagram-clone . All i'm doing here is turning an html+css project into a react project

this project makes use of a template provided by respondeAi:

create-react-app <some-folder-name-here> --template @bootcamp-ra/cra-template
